In C# code keep opening curly braces in the same line as the statement that opens the scope.

Simplify initialization, for example instead of 
var panelBg = new ColorRect();
panelBg.Color = new Color(0, 0, 0, 0.7f); 
panelBg.Size = new Vector2(250, 100);

Do
var panelBg = new ColorRect {
    Color = new Color(0, 0, 0, 0.7f),
    Size = new Vector2(250, 100)
};
