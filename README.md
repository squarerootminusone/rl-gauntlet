Gauntlet is a competitive RL playground that lets anyone build, test, and continuously evaluate methods solving complex strategy/tactics problems autonomously. Gauntlet aims to emulate environments of competitive video games like [League of Legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grx84OnbuEw), [Dota 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwRFkDuj5rY), and [Valorant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rxwnC7ygg) but with bots being first-class citizens.

Gauntlet provides:
- Games (competitive environments) based on the [Gymnasium API](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)
- Matchmaking and global leaderboards
- A public bot registry with match history 
- Controls and graphical interface for self-play (rather than just bot-play)
